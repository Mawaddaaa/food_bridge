# Food Bridge 

**Food Bridge** is a mobile application designed to help in reducing food waste by connecting donors (individuals or restaurants with surplus food) with recipients (charities or people in need).  
This app aims to streamline the process of food sharing and make it more accessible and efficient.

This application was developed as  our **graduation project**.  
It demonstrates our technical and social responsibility efforts to contribute to solving food surplus challenges in our community.
